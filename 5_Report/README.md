## Description
 * Tic-tac-toe in America , also known as noughts and crosses , or Xs and Os in Irish english, is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. It is usually played on paper but as the technology evolved, here is it's digital version.

### Explanation:
* The game starts giving you three input options(1, 2, 3):
    * 1 means you are playing with'X'.
    * 2 means you are playing with 'O'.
    * 3 means you exit the game.
* The game ends when:
    * User wins.
    * The computer wins.
    * It is in a draw situation , i.e, a total of 9 moves have been completed and none won.
* The game continues in the beginning if the check for draw is false.
* Then it checks if anyone has won yet.
* If not, then it again checks if it is a draw situation.
